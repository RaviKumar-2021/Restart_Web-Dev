	1.	Solve the following tasks using JavaScript.
	2.	Use if-else statements for decision-making.
	3.	Use for loops for iteration wherever necessary.
	4.	Use arrays to store and manipulate data.


    Tasks

    Task 1: Even or Odd Checker

        Write a program that checks each number in an array of integers and prints whether it is even or odd.

        Example Input:
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        Example Output:
        1 is Odd
        2 is Even
        3 is Odd    
        …

    
    
    
    Task 2: Find the Largest Number

        Create a program that finds the largest number in an array of integers.

        Example Input:
        [23, 45, 12, 67, 34]
        Example Output:
        The largest number is 67


    
    
    Task 3: Count Vowels in Strings

        Write a program to count the total number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in an array of strings.

        Example Input:
        ["hello", "world", "javascript"]
        Example Output:
        Total vowels: 7

    
    
    Task 4: Calculate Total and Average

        Create a program to calculate the total and average of numbers stored in an array.

        Example Input:
        [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
        Example Output:
        Total: 150
        Average: 30


    
    Task 5: Filter Positive Numbers

        Write a program that filters and prints only the positive numbers from an array.

        Example Input:
        [-1, 3, -5, 7, 9, -2]
        Example Output:
        Positive numbers: 3, 7, 9



    Task 6: Word Length Checker

        Create a program that checks the length of each word in an array of strings and categorizes them as “Short” (length ≤ 4), “Medium” (length 5–7), or “Long” (length > 7).

        Example Input:
        ["apple", "is", "delicious", "and", "healthy"]
        Example Output:
        apple: Medium
        is: Short
        delicious: Long
        …


    Task 7: Reverse Array Elements

        Write a program that reverses the order of elements in an array.

        Example Input:
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        Example Output:
        [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]



    Task 8: Search an Element

        Write a program to check if a specific element exists in an array. Print “Found” if the element exists and “Not Found” otherwise.

        Example Input:
        Array: [10, 20, 30, 40]
        Search Element: 20
        Example Output:
        Found


    Task 9: Count Even Numbers

        Write a program to count the total number of even numbers in an array.

        Example Input:
        [12, 17, 19, 24, 36, 45]
        Example Output:
        Even numbers count: 3



    Task 10: Replace Negative with Zero

        Create a program that replaces all negative numbers in an array with 0.

        Example Input:
        [-5, 7, -3, 9, -8]
        Example Output:
        [0, 7, 0, 9, 0]
